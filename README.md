# Arrow

A feature-rich, lightweight website base you can use to build .NET Blazor websites FAST.

Built in C#, Blazor, and .NET 10!

# Best Uses

While you can use Arrow for production-grade code, I recommend using it to prototype quickly and ship working, secure web applications.  Should you find a need to extend and grow your application, or rearchitect it (e.g. to use a Clean Architecture), you can always adapt that later.
